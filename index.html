            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello there! I'm a former teacher turned full-stack software developer with a knack for quickly adapting to new technologies and working with teammates. My journey in tech started with a deep-seated love for problem-solving and an interest in the connections between technology, language, and culture.</p>
        
                <p>My tech toolkit includes Spring Boot, Java, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, and more. Whether it's designing responsive UIs or testing with JUnit, I'm always ready to dive in and learn. I've worked on projects like a Tabletop RPG Inventory Management System and a clone of ChatGPT that have allowed me to apply these skills in real-world contexts. Check them out in my projects section!</p>
            
                <p>Before my foray into tech, I spent time as a Latin and Ancient History teacher, where I not only honed my communication skills but also learned how to efficiently manage and track progress, skills that have served me well in the world of coding.</p>
            
                <p>I'm currently polishing my skills at Tech Elevator, a 30-week full-stack coding bootcamp, where I've already logged 800+ hours of development education and application. I'm eagerly looking forward to bringing my passion for creating efficient and effective tech solutions into an entry-level software development role.</p>
            
                <p>Feel free to explore my portfolio and get in touch. I'm always open to new opportunities and conversations about tech!</p>
